#X text 21 50 each instance of the external has 3 creation arguments
with defaults values;
#X text 21 83 1st arg: is the length of the impulse response used for
filtering \, default value is 128;
#X text 22 115 2nd arg: is the filtering method: default value is 'RIFF'
\, which means that the filtering will be done in temporal domain:
this method has a huge computational cost \, but 0 ltency. The other
supported filtering method is 'FFT' \, it lowers the filtering cost
\, implies more latency \, and require to use the external in a block
\, examples will be given later.;
#X text 23 198 3rd arg: if set to 'nodelay' then interpolation is done
directly on the HRIR \, and results in less computations \, but results
in a not so good itd estimation in the interpolated filter. Otherwise
\, we proceed to a minimalphase and pure delay decomposition of the
HRIR. The user may chose the fractional delay algorithm used between
'Hermite4' \, '6points' \, 'linear' \, and 'nofractional'. Default
value for the 3rd arg is 'Hermite4' \, '6points' is also a good method
but more expensive. 'linear' and 'nofractional' should not be used
\, except for didactic purposes.;
